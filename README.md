# Assignment Regarding the Internship Application from Twixia - ML & AI!

**Build a custom model by training a few product data (e.g. Product name, category, brand, price, size) using any open transformers & models, which should generate a price comparison for a product.**

Hi there, my name is Ashfa!
I have collected two Kaggle datasets to create custom data models that can be used to compare housing prices and fashion clothing prices. You can access the housing price dataset through this URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anmolkumar/house-price-prediction-challenge. 

Additionally, I have created another model to compare fashion clothing prices based on various features such as category, color, gender, size, and brand. You can access the fashion clothing dataset through this URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/fashion-clothing-products-catalog/code. 

These models include different features and are designed to generate price comparisons to fulfill their respective tasks.
