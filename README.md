# Assignment Regarding the Internship Application from Twixia - ML & AI!

**Build a custom model by training a few product data (e.g. Product name, category, brand, price, size) using any open transformers & models, which should generate a price comparison for a product.**

Hi there, my name is Ashfa!



I have collected a Kaggle dataset to create a custom model that can be used to compare fashion clothing prices according to category, color, gender, size, and brand. You can access the dataset through this URL https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/fashion-clothing-products-catalog/code.   The model includes different features and this model generates fashion clothing prize comparison to complete the task.
