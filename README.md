# Assignment Regarding the Internship Application from Twixia - ML & AI!

## Build a custom model by training a few product data (e.g. Product name, category, brand, price, size) using any open transformers & models, which should generate a price comparison for a product.

Hi there, my name is Ashfa! 
I have collected a Kaggle dataset to create a custom model that can be used to predict house prices. You can access the dataset through this URL https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anmolkumar/house-price-prediction-challeng](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/fashion-clothing-products-catalog/code.
The model includes different features and this model generates house price comparison to complete the task by using Linear Regression.
